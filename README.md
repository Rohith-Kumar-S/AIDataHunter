# AI vs Human Text Classification Pipeline  
### CS 6220 - Data Mining Project  

This project implements a complete end-to-end workflow for detecting whether a given piece of text was written by a human or generated by an AI system. The pipeline focuses on scalable preprocessing, meaningful feature engineering, robust model training, and comprehensive evaluation, providing a reproducible framework for large-scale text classification.

## Overview  

The goal of this project is to distinguish AI-generated text from human-written text using a combination of traditional machine-learning algorithms and deep learning models.  
A unified dataset was prepared by combining multiple sources containing labeled human and AI text. After preprocessing, vectorization, and structured model training, we evaluated multiple models to understand which approaches generalize best.

This project demonstrates:

- Clean and modular preprocessing for large text datasets  
- Feature engineering based on linguistic and structural patterns  
- Handling imbalance through class-weight computation  
- Training and evaluation of multiple ML and transformer-based models  
- Analysis of failure modes and pattern-based insights

## Pipeline Workflow  

The notebook implements the following core stages:

### **1. Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
- Lowercasing, whitespace normalization  
- Expansion of contractions (e.g., *can't → can not*)  
- Duplicate removal  
- Label validation  
- Lemmatization for standardized token representation  

### **2. Structural Feature Engineering**  
The pipeline extracts additional numeric features that help distinguish writing styles:  
- Character, word, and estimated sentence counts  
- Punctuation distributions  
- Average word length  
- Lexical diversity  

### **3. Vectorization & Scaling**  
The cleaned text is transformed using:  
- TF-IDF (word-level)  
- Bag-of-Words representation  

Numeric text features are standardized to ensure compatibility with ML models.  
Class weights are computed to balance the learning signal across human/AI labels.

### **4. Dataset Splitting**  
A stratified split ensures equal representation of both classes across train, validation, and test sets.  
This supports fair comparison and prevents hidden bias.

### **5. Model Training & Evaluation**  
Models trained include:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest 
- Transformer-based BERT fine-tuning  

Evaluation focuses on:  
- Accuracy  
- Precision / Recall for both classes  
- F1-score  

Additionally, hyperparameter tuning had been applied to all the models to achieve the best perfromance.

## Key Results  

### **Traditional Machine Learning Models**  
- Logistic Regression improved from ~84% to ~89% accuracy after tuning.  
- Random Forest improved from ~85% to **91% accuracy** after systematic hyperparameter exploration.  

### **BERT-Based Deep Learning Model**  
- Achieved **93% accuracy**  
- AI-recall: **93%** (very strong at catching AI text)  
- Human-recall: **92%**  
- F1-score: **0.93**  

This shows that both classical and deep learning models can effectively detect writing patterns, with transformers providing the strongest generalization.

- Multimodal detection  
- Adversarial-resistant classifiers  
- Domain-specific detectors
